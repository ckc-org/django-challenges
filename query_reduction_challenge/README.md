# Query Reduction Challenge
This challenge presents a common problem in django-rest-framework. When a queryset gets serialized, it's related objects sometimes spur a flurry a
queries. Prevent this from happening by overriding `UserViewSet.get_queryset`. Make `test_users_endpoint_has_reasonable_query_count` pass.

In order to participate in this challenge, create a PR with your GitHub username as the name. There will be a comment on your PR when it gets
approved.
